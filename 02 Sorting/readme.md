### 1. Bubble Sort 
 - In the bubble sort, its runs **1 to N-1** times.
 - In each steps, we swap **array[ j ]** with **array[ j+1 ]** , IF **( j > j+1 )**
 - **(optional - see code)** last element is always sorted, so the limit reduced by 1 after every execution. For Example, at first its run to the limit n-2 then n-3,n-4,n-5....... to n-n
